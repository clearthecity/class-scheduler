  <h2>A Complex Scheduling Problem</h2>
</header>

<section id="about-main">
  <h2>Simulation</h2>
  <p><strong>Rooms.</strong> 10% of the rooms are art studios, 15% are science labs, and 15% are computer labs. At least 10% of the rooms are lecture halls (which seat a large class) and about 25% of the rooms seat a medium-sized class. About 80% of rooms are wheelchair accessible.</p>
  <p><strong>Courses.</strong> Each course meets for one hour, one day per week (hey, it&rsquo;s a model). The requirements of each course are determined by random variables. About 5% of courses require a wheelchair accessible room. A few courses will be nearly impossible to assign in a satisfactory way (e.g., a computing course with 60 students); in this respect, the model is realistic.</p>
  <p><strong>Professors.</strong> About 5% of professors have a family or medical obligation that cuts into their work availability. When the week length is 1 or 2 days, these professors have 4 hours of one day blocked off; when the week length is longer, they have one day blocked off. These restrictions are strictly enforced in both MCV and the genetic algorithm. An additional 20% of professors have a preference for either morning or afternoon classes. These requests are not strictly enforced, but they do contribute to the satisfaction score for a course.</p>
  <p><strong>Satisfaction.</strong> An integer representing how happy the students and professor are with the assigned room and timeslot. An ideal assignment has a score of 100. Serious problems (e.g., a course that needs to be in an art studio isn&rsquo;t given one; an inaccessible room given a wheelchair user) lose 60 to 70 points. A room that&rsquo;s too small loses 3*(students in the course - seats in the room) points. Minor annoyances (e.g., a non-science class in a science lab; a professor who doesn&rsquo;t like mornings; a room that’s far too big) lose 10 to 20 points. An unassigned course has a satisfaction score of -500. </p>

  <h2>Algorithms</h2>
  <p><strong>Most Constrained Variable First.</strong></p>
  <p><em>Assignment, first pass: most constrained variables.</em>  For each Course in the array, check if the room requires an art studio, science lab, computer lab, or large lecture hall. In those cases, choose a random timeslot and make sure the professor is available.  Search the rooms array for an appropriate room that’s available during the timeslot. Check wheelchair access if needed.</p> 
  <p><em>Second pass: moderately constrained variables.</em>  For each unassigned Course in the array, see if it needs a medium-sized room or a wheelchair-accessible room. In those cases, choose a random timeslot, make sure the professor is available, and find an appropriate room.</p>
  <p><em>Third pass: requests.</em>  Among the remaining unassigned courses, if the professor prefers early/late meetings, try to find an available room at an early/late time.</p>
  <p><em>Fourth pass: lightning round.</em> Force the remaining unassigned courses into rooms and timeslots, regardless of fit.</p>
  <p><em>Results</em>. Get the satisfaction score for each course in its assigned room and time, and the average satisfaction for the whole schedule.</p>
  <br>

  <p><strong>Genetic Algorithm.</strong></p>
  <p><em>Populate first generation.</em>  A two-dimensional array, current_gen, is filled with of POPULATION_SIZE randomly generated schedules, with two constraints: a professor can’t teach two courses at once, and a room can’t hold two classes at once. The best schedule is stored in current_best[]. Increment generation count.</p>
  <p><em>Next generations (runs NUM_GENERATIONS-1 times or until stopped).</em>  The schedules in current_gen are evaluated for fitness based on average satisfaction scores. The best schedule in the generation is compared with current_best, with current_best updated if necessary. CROSSOVER_RATE percent of the schedules in the current generation “mate” to produce offspring. If there is a collision in a room or professor timetable, we make a small change to a course booking (e.g., move it ahead one hour). Push offspring and survivors onto new_gen, a 2D array. The constant MUTATION_RATE determines how likely a schedule is to undergo mutation. If a schedule mutates, the constant DEGREE_OF_MUTATION determines the maximum number of courses that will be changed (again, avoiding collisions). Set current_gen to point to the new_gen array. Increment generation count.</p>
  <p><em>Results.</em> The schedules in current_gen are evaluated for fitness one more time. The best schedule in the generation is compared with the overall best, with current_best[] updated if necessary. The schedule in current_best is displayed to the user, along with average satisfaction.</p>
