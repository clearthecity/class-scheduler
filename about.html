  <h2>A Complex Scheduling Problem</h2>
</header>

<section id="about-main">
  <h2>Simulation</h2>
  <p><strong>Rooms.</strong> 10% of the rooms are art studios, 15% are science labs, and 15% are computer labs. At least 10% of the rooms are lecture halls (which seat a large class) and about 25% of the rooms seat a medium-sized class. About 80% of rooms are wheelchair accessible.</p>
  <p><strong>Courses.</strong> Each course meets for one hour, one day per week (hey, it&rsquo;s a model). The requirements of each course are determined by random variables. About 5% of courses require a wheelchair accessible room. A few courses will be nearly impossible to assign in a satisfactory way (e.g., a computing course with 60 students); in this respect, the model is realistic.</p>
  <p><strong>Professors.</strong> About 5% of professors have a family or medical obligation that cuts into their work availability. When the week length is 1 or 2 days, these professors have 4 hours of one day blocked off; when the week length is longer, they have one day blocked off. These restrictions are strictly enforced in both MCV and the genetic algorithm. An additional 20% of professors have a preference for either morning or afternoon classes. These requests are not strictly enforced, but they do contribute to the satisfaction score for a course.</p>
  <p><strong>Satisfaction.</strong> An integer representing how happy the students and professor are with the assigned room and timeslot. An ideal assignment has a score of 100. Serious problems (e.g., a course that needs to be in an art studio isn&rsquo;t given one; an inaccessible room given a wheelchair user) lose 60 to 70 points. A room that&rsquo;s too small loses 3*(students in the course - seats in the room) points. Minor annoyances (e.g., a non-science class in a science lab; a professor who doesn&rsquo;t like mornings; a room thatâ€™s far too big) lose 10 to 20 points. An unassigned course has a satisfaction score of -500. </p>

  <h2>Algorithms</h2>
  <p><strong>Most Constrained Variable First.</strong> Lorem ipsum</p>

  <p><strong>Genetic Algorithm.</strong> Lorem ipsum ... <em>Mutation</em>: The constant MUTATION_RATE determines how likely a schedule is to undergo mutation. If a schedule mutates, the constant DEGREE_OF_MUTATION determines the maximum number of courses that will be changed.</p>
